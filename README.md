# Overview

---

A React front-end made using an existing API made by a fellow cohort student. Emil.

# Description

---

A webpage front-end made with an API that was created by Emil. I took what information he had on the API and was able to create this website. I added my own design choices and chose my own images.

# Thoughts and Approach

---

I use React bootstrap to import and use the carousel components. This was the first time I tried using carousel and it turned out to be very interesting.

# Issues

---

1. One issue that came up was that the images from the API were not PNGS and thus I could not use them for the website. I instead had to convert those images into transparent background images in order to use them.

# Future Goals

---

1. Stylistic changes, perhaps more things to populate the page.

# Technologies Used

---

1. CSS
2. HTML
3. JavaScript
4. React
5. Netlify
